Yilie Huang is a PhD candidate in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University, under the guidance of [Professor Xunyu Zhou](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty-staff/directory/xunyu-zhou). His research lies at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL), stochastic control, and financial engineering. He focuses on developing and analyzing continuous-time RL algorithms to optimize financial and control systems operating under uncertainty.

Huang earned an M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University in 2018 and a B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Zhejiang University in 2017.

<!-- Key highlights of my work include:


-	Continuous-Time RL for Asset Allocation: I propose a continuous-time actor-critic RL algorithm tailored for mean-variance (MV) portfolio optimization. The algorithm converges to optimal policy parameters with a sublinear regret bound of O(N^{1/2}). Empirically, using US stocks data from January 2000 to December 2019, it demonstrates superior performance over traditional strategies, especially during the 2007-2008 financial crisis.


-	Model-Free RL in Linear-Quadratic (LQ) Control: This study applies continuous-time RL to linear-quadratic control problems where volatilities depend on both state and control variables, utilizing a model-free approach. The proposed actor-critic algorithm achieves a sublinear Sregret bound of O(N^{3/4}) and surpasses recent model-based methods in numerical comparisons, validating its effectiveness and reliability through simulation studies.-->
