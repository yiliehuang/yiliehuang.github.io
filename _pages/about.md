Yilie Huang is a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University, supervised by [Professor Xun Yu Zhou](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty-staff/directory/xunyu-zhou). His research lies at the intersection of **reinforcement learning (RL)**, **diffusion models**, **stochastic control**, and **financial engineering**, with a focus on developing and analyzing **continuous-time RL algorithms** to optimize financial and control systems under uncertainty.

Huang earned his PhD in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University in 2024, where he was advised by [Professor Xun Yu Zhou](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty-staff/directory/xunyu-zhou). He also holds an M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University (2018) and a B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Zhejiang University (2017).

### Key Contributions:
- **Continuous-Time RL for Portfolio Optimization**: Developed a **continuous-time actor-critic RL algorithm** for mean-variance (MV) portfolio optimization. This algorithm achieves a **sublinear regret bound** in terms of the Sharpe ratio, with strong empirical results using U.S. stock data from 2000 to 2019, demonstrating superior performance against 14 established strategies, particularly during bear markets.

- **Model-Free RL in Linear-Quadratic (LQ) Control**: Proposed **model-free reinforcement learning algorithms** for continuous-time LQ problems, addressing scenarios where volatilities depend on both state and control variables. Introduced two actor-critic approaches—one with deterministic exploration and another with adaptive exploration—that achieve **sublinear regret bounds**. These methods outperform recent model-based techniques in numerical experiments.

Yilie Huang’s work bridges the gap between theory and application, advancing decision-making strategies in uncertain environments. Explore his [Publications](https://yiliehuang.github.io/publications) and [CV](https://yiliehuang.github.io/files/CV_Yilie_Huang.pdf) for more details.
